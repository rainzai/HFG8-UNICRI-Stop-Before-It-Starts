# Stop Before It Starts

**Hackathon for Good #8** | 6-8 November 2026 | The Hague

**Challenge owner:** [UNICRI Centre for AI and Robotics](https://unicri.it/) and the UAE Ministry of Interior — [AI for Safer Children](https://aiforsaferchildren.com/) initiative.

## The Challenge

Most child protection technology works after abuse has happened. This challenge works one step earlier: at the moment someone goes looking for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online. Warning messages already run on some large platforms, and help services exist in the Netherlands, but very few platforms show a warning and very few people who see one go on to seek help.

**Your challenge:** build a plug-and-play prevention package that platforms in the Netherlands can switch on in days rather than months — combining a warning message, a route to help, and easy integration — ready to scale to other countries and languages.

Think of the target: a Dutch hobby forum with 20,000 members and one part-time moderator, who wants a warning and a route to help live within a week. What would it take for them to say yes?

Read the [full challenge brief](../BRIEF.md) or the [PDF version](../UNICRI%20Challenge%20Brief%20HFG%238.pdf).

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+ and npm.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo (or your fork)
git clone https://github.com/Hackathon-for-Good-The-Hague/HFG8-UNICRI-Stop-Before-It-Starts.git
cd HFG8-UNICRI-Stop-Before-It-Starts

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run the safety check
npm run check

# 4. Start the mock platform and backend
npm run dev

# 5. Open the mock platform
#    http://localhost:3000/mock-platform/

# 6. Type "test-trigger-red" in the search bar to see the warning
```

That is all. You should see the mock platform with a search bar. Typing `test-trigger-red` triggers the warning flow. From here, build your solution.

## Safety Rules

This challenge deals with the prevention of CSAM. The safety rules are non-negotiable.

1. **No real abuse-related search terms** — only `test-trigger-*` placeholders
2. **No real people or user data** — everything is synthetic
3. **No tooling that identifies, exposes or tracks individuals**
4. **Aggregate measurement only** — counts suppressed below 10
5. **Do not invent facts** — verify or mark with `[VERIFY]`

Run `npm run check` before every commit. Read the full rules in [SAFETY.md](../SAFETY.md).
