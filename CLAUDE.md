# CLAUDE.md — Context for AI Coding Assistants

This is the challenge repository for the **UNICRI Stop Before It Starts** challenge at **Hackathon for Good #8** (6-8 November 2026, The Hague).

## Our Build

We build a hosted warning-to-help page in `web/` that platforms redirect to. Architecture, decisions and privacy rules: @docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

## What This Repo Is

A hackathon challenge repository — not a software project. It contains starter code, data files, templates and documentation. Participants fork this repo and build their solutions on top of it.

## The Challenge

Build a plug-and-play prevention package that platforms can install in days to warn people searching for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and guide them to help services. The target is small and mid-sized platforms in the Netherlands (e.g. a 20K-member forum with one part-time moderator), with the design ready to scale to other countries and languages. Three building blocks: the warning message, the route to help, and the plug-and-play integration layer.

## Safety Rules — CRITICAL

AI assistants working in this repository MUST follow these rules:

1. **No real abuse-related search terms.** The ONLY trigger terms allowed are fake placeholders starting with `test-trigger-` (e.g. `test-trigger-red`, `test-trigger-amber`). Never generate, suggest or include real abuse-related terms.
2. **No real people, chats or user data.** Everything is synthetic.
3. **No tooling that identifies, exposes or tracks individuals.**
4. **Measurement is aggregate only** — counts suppressed below 10.
5. **Do not invent facts.** Phone numbers, URLs, legal articles and research findings must come from verified sources. If unsure, add a `[VERIFY]` marker.
6. **Write message texts in your own words** — do not copy from existing platforms.

Run `npm run check` before every commit. It enforces the trigger-term rule.

## Technical Stack

- **Runtime:** Node 20+
- **Module system:** ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- **Frontend:** Vite dev server
- **Backend:** Express
- **Validation:** Ajv (JSON Schema)
- **Tests:** Node built-in test runner (`node --test`)
- **No database** — everything is file-based or in-memory

## Key Commands

```bash
npm run dev                # Start mock platform + backend (Vite + Express via concurrently)
npm run check              # Run safety check
npm test                   # Run tests
npm run generate:traffic   # Generate synthetic traffic data → tools/dashboard/generated/
npm run dashboard          # Open impact dashboard at localhost:3002
```
